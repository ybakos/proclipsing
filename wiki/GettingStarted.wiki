= Getting Started : Installing Proclipsing & Creating a Project=

= Introduction =

This Tutorial will show you how to install Proclipsing and Create a Project with it.  It will walk you through adding the Proclipsing Plugin to Eclipse and creating your first Proclipsing project.

= Details =

Initially, we are focusing on project creation.  To this end, the
plugin allows you to select the location of your processing app, which
libraries you want, and then creates a project with the desired libs
(with native libraries), and skeleton package structure and PApplet.

===Download Eclipse:===
